### CMIP5 P<sub>50</sub> Tuna Analysis  
-----------------------------  
The CMIP5 P<sub>50</sub> Tuna analysis calculates blood-oxygen binding, which is a mechanism determining hypoxia tolerance in the ocean.  Blood-oxygen binding is measured as the oxygen pressure in the blood at which whole blood is 50% oxygenated, called P<sub>50</sub>. A low P<sub>50</sub> means that respiratory pigments in the blood of an organism equilibrate to 100% oxygenation at lower oxygen pressures, and the organism is more hypoxia tolerant. Temperature alters hypoxia tolerance by shifting the P<sub>50</sub> of organisms.  According to results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) RCP 8.5, temperature and oxygen are projected to change by 2100.  This analysis calculates the effects of these changes on the blood-oxygen binding and hypoxia tolerance of tuna species.  Comparisons are made among tuna species with different physiological adaptations.

#### WOA data

The WOA data files that serve as the starting point for this analysis can be downloaded here:   
[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.807748](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.807748)

#### CMIP5 results   

Files with some pre-processing were used for this study.  The pre-processing included regridding the results from each model to the WOA grid.  Also, the projected changes in temperature and oxygen concentrations were calculated by subtracting the 30 year average of historical results from 1975 to 2005 from the 30 year average of the future projections from 2070 to 2100.

#### IUCN data

Request spatial data for tuna range areas from IUCN Red List of Threatened Species:  
[http://www.iucnredlist.org/](http://www.iucnredlist.org/)   
<br>
Tuna species: skipjack tuna (*Katsuwonus pelamis*), yellowfin tuna (*Thunnus albacares*), southern bluefin tuna (*Thunnus maccoyii*), bigeye tuna (*Thunnus obesus*), Pacific bluefin tuna (*Thunnus orientalis*), Atlantic bluefin tuna (*Thunnus thynnus*), albacore tuna (*Thunnus alalunga*), blackfin tuna (*Thunnus atlanticus*), and longtail tuna (*Thunnus tonggol*).  
<br>
If granted access, download the data and put the folders, `species_#####`, with the data in the `data/IUCN` folder.  


-------------------------------
#### Running the analysis code
-------------------------------
All of the following commands assume that the current directory is the CMIP5_p50_tuna folder. The analysis is run in NOAA Ferret using shell scripts in the sh folder and .jnl files in the ferret folder.  WOA data is World Ocean Atlas 2009 data.  Projections refer to results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models.  

<br>

The first step in the analysis is to calculate the projected changes in temperature and oxygen over the next century.  Also, oxygen concentrations are converted to oxygen pressure.  

Generate projections for the end of the century by adding the modeled changes in ocean temperature and oxygen to WOA data.  Results from 6 models are saved in the `data/CMIP5/projections` folder.

    ferret < ferret/Projections_modeldiff_WOA_rcp8.5.jnl

Convert dissolved oxygen concentrations to oxygen pressure (pO<sub>2</sub>). Results from 6 models are saved in the `data/CMIP5/projections` folder.  WOA results are saved in the `data/WOA` folder.

    ferret < ferret/Projections_convert_pO2.jnl  
    ferret < ferret/WOA_convert_pO2.jnl

Calculate annual average pO<sub>2</sub> from WOA files with monthly data.     

    ferret < ferret/Calculate_PO2_monthly_average.jnl

<br>

The second step in the analysis is to calculate P<sub>50</sub> depth for tuna species.  The P<sub>50</sub> and &Delta;H values for the tuna species are in the `sh/Species_global4.csv` file.

Calculate p50 and p50 depth for the models and data.

    sh sh/Models_p50/p50depth_rcp8.5.sh < sh/Species_global4.csv
    sh sh/WOA_p50/WOA_p50depth.sh < sh/Species_global4.csv

Calculate the change in P<sub>50</sub> depth and then find the mean of the projections from all 6 models.

    sh sh/Models_p50/deltap50depth_rcp8.5.sh < sh/Species_global4.csv
    sh sh/Mean_AllModels/ModelMean_deltap50depth.sh < sh/Species_global4.csv

Convert IUCN Shape Files to NetCDF grid so that masks can be used to extract the P<sub>50</sub> depth just for the habitat area.

    sh sh/IUCN/IUCN_shptonc.sh
    sh sh/IUCN/ConvertTo5deg.sh < sh/Species_global4.csv
    sh sh/IUCN/NetCDF_To_ascii.sh < sh/Species_global4.csv

Use IUCN mask to extract P<sub>50</sub> depth for the habitat range of each tuna species from the models and WOA data.

    sh sh/IUCN_P50Depth/IUCN_modelmean_P50Depth.sh < sh/Species_global4.csv
    sh sh/IUCN_P50Depth/IUCN_modelmean_deltaP50Depth.sh < sh/Species_global4.csv
    sh sh/IUCN_P50Depth/IUCN_WOA_P50Depth.sh < sh/Species_global4.csv

Calculate projected changes in vertical separation for tuna.  First step is to calculate the number of tuna species with P<sub>50</sub> depth measurements globally.  

    ferret < ferret/IUCN_GeoNumSpecies_P50depthanalysis.jnl
    ferret < ferret/Calculate_P50Depth_CommonArea_deltaseparation.jnl

<br>

Calculate geospatial distribution of the number of tuna species as supporting information for the paper.

    mkdir results/IUCN
    ferret < ferret/IUCN_GeoNumSpecies.jnl
